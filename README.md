This app has most useful case in countries like India where, when you hire a maid you have to mark those dates when they do not come to work (home,office etc) through this app you can save those dates and according to that salary will be calculated. 

Similarly if you appoint any person may be superman, spider-man, flash or Arrow.. :P then there attendances for not coming at crime scenario can be marked by you. But as they work voluntarily so you save money :D
